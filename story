Request for handling live Class
If a user wants to hold a live class, they go to our handle a live class page and fill a form submitting title of class and content. After we review we send them link to accept the class and proceed to add the class details, resources, test, date/time etc. The system should send reminder (SMS/Emails/Push Notifications) at intervals if the authors have not added details. If an author wants to have other authors anchoring a class, we can add those authors from backend. We send notifications (email/push) to users at interval notifying them of the starting time. We decide when a live class is paid and fix price by our self. For private main class if a user fixes price we contact and evaluate to ensure the user will deliver quality.
